Hey it's me, just leaving some notes so I know what I'm doing next time.

It seems prudent to write a python script that runs on a cron job that connects to the db directly and populates the database by hand. This will be good for learning how to make queries and to make writes.

Wait maybe I should be doing it through JS and organizing on page seeing as how I get 100 interactions per second.
